# quaternion-wrapper

This is a wrapper for the [quaternion](https://github.com/HamaguRe/quaternion) library.

Provides various operations on quaternion.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
quaternion-wrapper = "0.1"
```

## Features

See the [quaternion](https://github.com/HamaguRe/quaternion) library documentation for details on each feature.

```toml
[dependencies.quaternion-wrapper]
version = "0.1"

# Uncomment if you wish to use FMA and SIMD.
#features = ["fma", "simd"]
```

## Example

`src/main.rs`:

```rust
use quaternion_wrapper::{QuaternionWrapper, Vector3Wrapper};

const PI: f64 = std::f64::consts::PI;
const EPSILON: f64 = 1e-14;

fn main() {
    // Generates a quaternion representing the
    // rotation of Ï€/2[rad] around the y-axis.
    let q = QuaternionWrapper::from_axis_angle([0.0, 1.0, 0.0], PI/2.0);

    // Vector
    let v = Vector3Wrapper([2.0, 2.0, 0.0]);

    let result = (q * v * q.conj()).get_vector_part();
    //let result = q.vector_rotation(v);  // <--- It could be written like this

    // Check if the calculation is correct.
    let true_val = Vector3Wrapper([0.0, 2.0, -2.0]);
    let diff: [f64; 3] = (result - true_val).unwrap();
    for val in diff.iter() {
        assert!(val.abs() < EPSILON);
    }
}
```
